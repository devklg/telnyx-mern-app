# 🚀 BMAD V4 Execution Plan v3.0
## Dependency-Based Agent Implementation Strategy

**Created:** 2025-10-21  
**Version:** 3.0 - Dependency-Based Execution  
**Replaces:** v2.0 (Timeline-Based Approach)

---

## ⚡ CRITICAL PARADIGM

### **Autonomous Agents = Dependency-Driven, NOT Time-Driven**

**WRONG APPROACH (v2.0):**
```
Week 1, Day 1-2: Do X
Week 1, Day 3-4: Do Y
Week 2: Do Z
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ Artificial constraints
- ❌ Ignores agent autonomy
- ❌ Assumes linear progress
- ❌ Doesn't leverage parallelism

**CORRECT APPROACH (v3.0):**
```
Phase 1: Foundation Prerequisites
    ├─ Complete when: Infrastructure ready
    └─ Unblocks: Phase 2
    
Phase 2: Core Development
    ├─ Complete when: All dependencies satisfied
    └─ Unblocks: Phase 3
    
Phase 3: Integration & Testing
    ├─ Complete when: All systems integrated
    └─ Unblocks: Production
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Natural Flow:** Agents work when dependencies complete
- ✅ **True Parallelism:** Multiple agents work simultaneously
- ✅ **Adaptive:** Handles blockers organically
- ✅ **Scalable:** Add agents without timeline conflicts

Phase 2 (Pilot): $30-50
    - 3 agents, 10 tasks
    - Proof of autonomous execution
    
Phase 3 (Scale): $50-100
    - 10 agents, 40 tasks
    - Parallel execution
    
Phase 4 (Full Deploy): $150-200

## 🚀 IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH

### **Starting Phase 1:**

**Human Role:**
1. Install Claude Code SDK: `npm install @anthropic-ai/claude-code-sdk`
2. Deploy hook endpoints (already in `routes/hooks.js`)
3. Start dashboard: `npm run dev`
4. Spawn first test agent
5. Verify webhook delivery
6. **Then step back and let agents work**

**Agent Role:**
1. Agent boots with identity from Neo4j
2. Queries task graph for assignments
3. Executes tasks autonomously
4. Sends progress via webhooks
5. Notifies dependent agents when complete
6. Creates PR automatically
7. Waits for next dependency to unlock

**Key Principle:**
> Humans set up infrastructure and spawn agents.  
> Agents coordinate and execute autonomously.  
> Humans monitor progress and handle exceptions only.

---

## 🔄 DEPENDENCY RESOLUTION

### **How Agents Know What To Do:**

1. **Agent Boots:**
   ```javascript
   // Agent queries Neo4j
   const myTasks = await neo4j.query(`
     MATCH (a:Agent {agentId: $id})-[:ASSIGNED_TO]->(t:Task)
     WHERE t.status = 'READY'
     RETURN t
   `, {id: agentId});
   ```

2. **Task Selection:**
   ```javascript
   // Check dependencies
   const readyTasks = myTasks.filter(task => 
     task.dependencies.every(dep => dep.status === 'COMPLETED')
   );
   ```

3. **Execution:**
   ```javascript
   // Work on first ready task
   const task = readyTasks[0];
   await executeTask(task);
   ```

4. **Completion:**
   ```javascript
   // Update graph
   await neo4j.query(`
     MATCH (t:Task {taskId: $id})
     SET t.status = 'COMPLETED', t.completedAt = datetime()
   `, {id: task.taskId});
   
   // Notify dependent agents via webhook
   await notifyDependentAgents(task);
   ```

## 📊 MONITORING & ADAPTATION

### **Real-Time Signals:**

**Green Signals (Proceed):**
- ✅ Tasks completing within expected time
- ✅ PRs merging successfully
- ✅ No blocking errors
- ✅ Agents collaborating smoothly
- ✅ Cost tracking on target

**Yellow Signals (Monitor):**
- ⚠️ Some tasks taking longer than average
- ⚠️ Occasional PR conflicts
- ⚠️ Minor errors (but agents recovering)
- ⚠️ Cost slightly elevated

**Red Signals (Intervene):**
- 🚨 Agents blocked for >2 hours
- 🚨 Critical failures in multiple agents
- 🚨 Security vulnerabilities detected
- 🚨 Cost exceeding $100/phase
- 🚨 Circular dependencies discovered

### **Adaptation Strategies:**

**If Blocked:**
- Review dependency graph for issues
- Check if prerequisite task failed
- Manually unblock if necessary
- Adjust task assignments

**If Cost Overruns:**
- Pause non-critical agents
- Batch small tasks
- Optimize agent prompts
- Review API usage patterns

**If Quality Issues:**
- Enable stricter PR reviews
- Add testing requirements
- Adjust agent instructions
- Implement quality gates

## 🎓 PHILOSOPHY: AGENT AUTONOMY

### **Core Principles:**

1. **Trust the Graph:**
   - Neo4j knows the dependencies
   - Agents follow the graph
   - Graph is single source of truth

2. **Parallel by Default:**
   - If no dependency, work in parallel
   - Don't serialize unnecessarily
   - Maximize throughput

3. **Fail Fast, Recover Fast:**
   - Agents detect failures early
   - Report via webhooks
   - Retry or escalate automatically

4. **Organic Scaling:**
   - Add agents when ready
   - Don't force artificial milestones
   - Let workload drive scaling

5. **Human as Exception Handler:**
   - Agents handle routine work
   - Humans resolve exceptions
   - Humans optimize process
